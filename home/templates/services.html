                      of Christ and biblical truths, we organise weekly Sunday
                      school services. These Sunday schools are run on the first

                      Keep Hill Road, High Wycombe. The Sunday school comprises
                      introductions, prayers, thought for the day, learning
                      songs, completion of assignments, presentations,
